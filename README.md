# What's changed in this fork

- Add a new completion provider [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/).
- Allow use completion without a tokenizer.
- Do not hack package.json on startup.
- Change extension logo (but not changed internal icons and settings).
  So it is not compatible with Flexpilot (the original extension).
  Make sure you have only enabled one of them.
  Also you have to disable GitHub Copilot to use this extension.

## Develop

- To keep in sync with the original extension:

  ```console
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/flexpilot-ai/vscode-extension.git
  $ git config --edit
  ```

  ```ini
  [remote "upstream"]
  url = https://github.com/flexpilot-ai/vscode-extension.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
  pushurl = DISABLE
  skipFetchAll = true
  ```

  ```console
  $ git fetch upstream release/1.95.2 --depth=1
  $ git fetch upstream release/1.95.3 --depth=1
  $ git switch -c merge-1.95.3
  $ git diff upstream/release/1.95.2 upstream/release/1.95.3 > /tmp/a.diff
  $ git apply /tmp/a.diff --reject --whitespace=fix
  ```
